Consensus has been quoted on this by: Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn Hazm, Ibn Battal, al-Nawawi, and al-`Iraqi<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. The prayer of the one who forgot he is in a state of hadath:</span><br>Whoever prays without purity out of forgetfulness or ignorant of his hadath must repeat his prayer. Consensus has been quoted on this matter by: Ibn `Abd al-Barr, al-Nawawi, Ibn Taymiyyah, and Ibn Rajab.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. The one missing the two purifiers:</span><br>Whoever does not find water or dust, or is kept away from them for a legitimate reason, <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [291] Such as being locked up as a   war prisoner or otherwise, tied to a bed, or ill to a degree that does not   allow him to use water or dust, and so on.     </span>  prays according to his condition and does not have to repeat. This is the position of the Hanbalis, Ashhab from the Malikis, and a position among Shafi`is. It is also the choice of al-Bukhari, Ibn Hazm, al-Nawawi, Ibn Taymiyyah, and Ibn `Uthaymin, and it is the verdict of the Permanent Committee.<br><span class="title-2" style="font-weight: normal;"><b><br></b></span><div style="font-weight: normal;"><span class="title-2" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><b>Secondly: Purification from Najas</b></span><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Purification from najas as a condition:</span><br>Purification from najas in one's body, clothes, and prayer areas is a condition for the validity of prayer. This is the position of the majority: Hanafis, Shafi`is, Hanbalis, a position among the Malikis, and it is narrated from the majority of scholars.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Removing najasah when unable to or being harmed:</span><br>If a person is unable to remove najasah or is harmed by its removal, then he prays with it without the need for repetition. This is the position of the Hanafis and a narration among Hanablis, as well as being the choice of Ibn Qudamah, Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Baz, and Ibn `Uthaymin.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Removing najasah during the prayer:</span><br>If najasah reaches the garment or body of a person in prayer, then he removed it until it had no remains on him, his prayer is valid. Consensus has been quoted over this by al-Nawawi and Ibn Hajar.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Praying with najasah out of ignorance or forgetfulness:</span><br>Whoever prays with a najasah on him out of ignorance or forgetfulness of it, then his prayer is valid and he does not need to repeat it. This is a narration from Ahmad and al-Shafi`i's old position. It is also the choice of Ibn al-Mundhir, al-Nawawi, Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn al-Qayyim, Ibn Baz, and Ibn `Uthaymin.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Uncertainty between pure clothes with najas or haram ones:</span><br>If pure clothes become mixed with najas or haram ones, likes stolen or forcefully taken clothes, then their owner seeks clarity and investigates, <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [292] Investigation is the seeking   of truth and searching for what is desired.      &nbsp;     </span>  and then prays in the ones he believes to be pure. This is the position of the Hanafis, Shafi`is, and a position among Malikis. It is also the choice of Ibn `Aqil al-Hanbali, Ibn Taymiyyah, and Ibn `Uthaymin; and it is quoted by al-Qadi Abu Tayyib as the position of the majority of scholars.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">6. Pray in the clothes of non-Muslims:</span><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span> What is sewn by disbelievers:<br>Prayer is permissible in clothes sewn or knitted by disbelievers. Ibn Qudamah has quoted consensus over this.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span> What has been worn by disbelievers:<br>Prayer is permissible in clothes that have been worn by disbelievers. <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [293] As long as he does not have certainty   it is najis.     </span>  This is the position of the majority: Hanafis, <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [294] It is permissible for Hanafis   to pray in the clothes of non-Muslim statesmen (dhimmis) except the izar   and the top, then it is makruh to pray in them since they are close to   the place of hadath, and they may not clean themselves adequately from   urine.     </span>  Shafi`is, Hanbalis, and Zahiris.<br><span class="title-2" style=""><b><br></b></span></div><div style="font-weight: normal;"><span class="title-2" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><b>Thirdly: Where the Prayer is Impermissible</b></span><span class="title-2" style="font-weight: normal;"> <span class="tip">            [295] Prayer is legislated in all   land generally; consensus has been quoted over that by Ibn Taymiyyah.     </span> </span><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Camel pens:</span> <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [296] A`tan is the place   where camels flock to drink especially, and it is said it is their abode   generally.     </span> <br>Prayer is invalid if performed in a camel pen. This is the position of the Hanbalis, it is narrated from Malik, and the position of a group of jurists. It is also the choice of Ibn Hazm and Ibn `Uthaymin.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Bathing areas:</span> <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [297] Ibn `Uthaymin said: “Hammam is   a bathing area where people come and wash themselves, … what is emant here is   not toilets.” Al-Sharh al-Mumti` (243/3)     </span> <br>Prayer in bathing areas is permissible but makruh. This is the position of the majority: Hanafis, Malikis, <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [298] But they said that if he is   certain of the purity of his area then there is no dislike.     </span>  Shafi`is, and a narration from Ahmad.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Graveyards:</span><span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;[299] For Hanbalis upon the relied   upon position of their school, one or two graves make no difference as long as   he does not reach it, and Ibn Taymiyyah viewed even that as problematic.     </span> <br>Prayer is invalid if performed in a graveyard. This is the position of the Hanbalis, and it is attributed to a lot of scholars. It is the position of Ibn Hazm, and the choice of Ibn Taymiyyah, al-San`ani, Ibn Baz, and `Uthaymin.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Tips:</span>&nbsp;<span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [300] Al-Mawardi said: “Mazbalah   is what has been collected together of najasah, dusted things, and   rubbish, even if it is pure.” Al-Insaf (346/1)     </span>  and butcheries<br>Prayer is valid if performed in a rubbish tip or at a butcher's as long as there is no najasah there. This is the position of the Hanafis and Malikis, and it is the choice of Ibn Hazm and Ibn Baz.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Trodden paths:</span>&nbsp;<span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [301] Qari`at al-tariq is   where people strike their feet often – the middle of the road. It has also been   said that it is the highest part of the road.     </span> <br>It is makruh to perform the prayer on trodden paths. This is the position of the majority: Hanafis, Malikis, and Shafi`is.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">6. Forcefully taken land:</span><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span>&nbsp;Ruling of prayer on usurped land:<br>Prayer is haram in usurped land.

The Prophet ﷺ did   not enter the Ka`bah until all images were removed therefrom. Likewise,   `Umar said: ‘We would not enter their temples while they still have images in   them.’ It is the same as a mosque built on a grave.” Majmu` al-Fatawa   (162/22)     </span>  This is the position of the majority: Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi`is, a narration from Ahmad, and the position of a group from the Salaf.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">8. Places of sin and devil habitation:</span><br>Performing prayer in places of sin and where devils habitate is makruh. This is the position of the majority: Hanafis, Malikis, and Shafi`is. <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [305] Al-Nawawi said: “Prayer in the   abodes of devils is makruh by agreement, like places for wine and other   lewd and obscene sins, and churches and synagogues, and their like.” Al-Majmu`   (162/3)     </span>  <br><b><span class="title-2" style=""><br></span></b></div><div style="font-weight: normal;"><b style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><span class="title-2" style="">Fourthly: Entering of the time</span><br></b><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. The time entering as a condition:</span><br>That the time for a prayer enters and it is prayed after that is a condition for its validity. Consensus has been quoted over this by: Ibn Rushd, Ibn Qudamah, Ibn `Abd al-Barr, and Ibn Hazm.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Praying before the due time:</span><br>It is haram to perform a prayer before its time. Whoever prays before the time, his prayer is not sufficient for him. Consensus has been quoted over this by Ibn `Abd al-Barr and Ibn Taymiyyah.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Delaying the prayer outside its time:</span><br>It haram to delay the prayer after its due time deliberately without an excuse. Consensus has been quoted over this by Ibn Hazm and Ibn Taymiyyah.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Time for fajr (dawn) prayer:</span><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span> Start of fajr:<br>The start of the fajr prayer is when the second twilight <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [306] The second twilight is the   scattered one, and it is the true fajr. It is called scattered due to   the scattering in the horizon.     </span>  appears. Consensus has been quoted that fajr starts with twilight and ends with sunrise: Ibn al-Mundhir, al-Tahawi, and Ibn Hazm. Ibn `Abd al-Barr and al-Nawawi quote consensus over its entering time being with twilight. <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span> Fajr prayer before its time:<br>It is haram to pray fajr before its time. Consensus has been quoted over this by al-Nawawi.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span> Taghlis&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13pt;">in fajr</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">:</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">&nbsp;</span><span class="tip" style="font-size: 13pt;">            [307] Taghlis is praying fajr   prayer in ghalas, which is the darkness at the very end of the night.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="font-weight: normal;">It is best to pray fajr in its early tine of validity if it has entered, and this is called Taghlis. This is the position of the majority: Malikis, Shafi`is, Hanbalis, Zahiris, and a group from the Salaf.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span> Ending of the time for fajr:<br>The optional time for fajr extends until sunrise. This is the Hanafi and Hanbali positions, <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [308] Al-Mardawi said: “The correct   position in the school is that there is no time for necessity, rather a time   for virtue and an optional time, like maghrib and zuhr.” Al-Insaf   (310/1)     </span>  and the correct position from Malik. It is the position of the majority of scholars from the early and late generations, as well as the choice of Ibn Taymiyyah, al-San`ani, Ibn Baz, and Ibn `Uthaymin.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Time for zuhr (midday) prayer:</span><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span> Start of zuhr:<br>The start of zuhr is when the sun is at its highest in the sky, at its zenith. Consensus has been quoted over this by: Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn Hazm, Ibn `Abd al-Barr, and al-Nawawi. <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span> Ending of zuhr:<br>The ending of zuhr prayer is when the shadow of a thing is the same as the length of the thing itself without the initial length that is there at the sun’s zenith. <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [309] Ibn Qudamah said: “The meaning   of zawal is its leaning away from the side of the sky, and this is known   through the length of a person’s shadow after ensuring it’s at its shortest.” Al-Mughni   (270/1)     </span>  This is the position of the majority: Malikis, Shafi`is, Hanbalis, Zahiris, and a narration from Abu Hanifah.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">-</span> Praying zuhr early:<br>It is mustahabb to pray zuhr early when it is neither hot nor rainy. Ibn Qadamah and al-Nawawi have quoted consensus over this matter.<br>It is Mustahabb to wait for the intense heat to subside before praying zuhr <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [310] Ibrad is to delay zuhr   until there is bard, which is the easing of the sun’s intense heat.   Scholars differed in its degree, and whether it is to do with the   congregational prayer only or not, and similar issues.     </span>  <br>It is mustahabb to wait for the cooling of zuhr in intense heat, and this is by agreement of the four schools of jurisprudence. <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [311] Hanafis view ibrad as   valid for summer unconditionally, regardless of how intense the heat is.     </span> <br><b style="font-weight: normal;">6.

This is the general position. <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [336] Some have excepted those who   are not in a situation where they must be consistently naked so have made it wajib   to repeat. Others said they repeat it in its time.     </span>  Consensus has been quoted over this by al-Nawawi and Ibn Taymiyyah.<br><b style="font-weight: normal;">-</b> Standing of the naked person if he is by himself:<br>If the naked person is praying by himself, he prays standing. This is the position of the Malikis, <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [337] According to them, it is mustahabb   to repeat in the time.     </span>  Shafi`is, <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [338] Shafi`is said: they may pray   individually or together. If they pray together and they can see, their Imam   stands between them. If he stands in front, his prayer is valid. If it is dark   or they cannot see each other then it is mustahabb they pray together   and their Imam stands in front of them.     </span>  a narration from Ahmad, a group from the Salaf, and the choice of Ibn Baz.<br><b style="font-weight: normal;">-</b> Description of congregational prayer for the naked:<br>A group of naked people pray in congregation in one line, and their imam stands between them in the middle. This is the position of the Shafi`is, Hanbalis, <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [339] Hanbalis said: if their Imam   stands in front of them their prayer is invalidated, if they cannot see out of   blindness or darkness then he may stand in front of them.     </span>  and the choice of Ibn Taymiyyah.<br><b style="font-weight: normal;">-</b> Standing of the naked in congregational prayer:<br>If a group of naked people pray in congregational prayer, they pray standing.
