                      Specifying the bride and groom: The four Madhabs agree that specifying the groom and bride is required and a condition that must be fulfilled.<br/>2.    The consent of the bride and groom: <br/>a.    The approval of the bride and groom who reached puberty: The majority of scholars, namely the Hanafi, Maliki <span class="tip">            [23] The Maliki   scholars hold the view that the guardian of the bride who reached puberty may   marry her off without her consent except if she expressed her disapproval,   detest, or  explicitly states that does not wish to marry.      </span> , and Hanbali, consider the approval of the bride and the groom <span class="tip">            [24] The approval of   the previously married woman who reached puberty must be made verbally, while   approval of the virgin who reached puberty can be made by remaining silent or   smiling when she is asked for her approval. As for the female who has not   reached puberty, it will be discussed in the next part.     </span> who reached puberty one of the conditions of the marriage contract.<br/>b.    The approval of the bride and groom if either of them has not reached puberty<br/>                                              i.      The approval of the groom who has not reached puberty: The four Madhabs agree that the father may wed his son, who has not reached puberty, to the bride, without his permission.<br/>                                             ii.     The approval of the bride who has not reached puberty <span class="tip">            [25] Unfortunately,   some guardians force their young female wards to marry old men, in the age of   their parents or even grandparents, out of their greed. They treat their female   wards as a commodity and marriage as a business deal without any consideration   to their best interest and rights. Indeed, this is a great injustice and   oftentimes this kind of marriages are doomed to fail.     </span> :<br/>1.    The ruling on the father who is marrying off his virgin daughter who has not reached puberty to the groom: The four Madhabs agree that the father has the right to marry his virgin daughter who has not reached puberty without her permission <span class="tip">            [26] Some scholars   hold the view that marriage is deemed null and void if this marriage does not   serve the best interest of the young girl, and the judge should annul it.     </span> .  <br/>2.    The ruling on the guardian, other than the father, marrying off his ward who has not reached puberty:  The guardian, other than the father, may marry off his virgin female ward <span class="tip">            [27] The Hanbali   scholars, Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Baaz and Ibn ‘Uthaymeen stipulated that she must   have reached the age of nine years.     </span>  who has not reached puberty. This is the view of the Hanafi Madhab <span class="tip">            [28] The Hanafi   scholars allowed it with the condition that she is given the choice after   reaching puberty, either to approve the marriage contract or nullify it.     </span> , the correct view of the Hanbali Madhab, and the view that Ibn Taymiyyah deemed to be the most correct, as well as the view of Ibn Baaz and Ibn ‘Uthaymeen.<br/>3.    The ruling on allowing the husband to consummate the marriage with his bride before she reaches puberty: It is impermissible for the husband to consummate the marriage with his wife before she reaches puberty if she is unfit to have intercourse. This is the view of the four Madhabs. <span class="tip">            [29] Some Hanbali   scholars specified that she should have reached 9 years while some other   scholars made the condition that she is able to have intercourse.      </span> <br/>4.    Marrying off a non-virgin girl (Arabic: thayyib <span class="tip">            [30] The Thayyib   refers to the girl who has lost her virginity due to lawful or unlawful   intercourse. For the purpose of this document, the term will be translated as   “non-virgin girl”.     </span> who has not reached puberty: The scholars differed on the ruling of marrying off a non-virgin girl who has not reached puberty. The majority of scholars, namely the Hanafi, Hanbali and Maliki scholars, hold the view that the father can marry off his non-virgin daughter who has not reached puberty without her consent. The other view does not allow it at all, be it was the father or any of her other guardians until she reaches puberty and gives her consent. This is the view of the Shafi’i Madhab and one of the views in the Hanbali Madhab, as well as the adopted position of Ibn Shibrimah, Ibn Hazm, and al-San’aanee. <br/>3.    Guardianship in marriage<br/>a.    Definition: The linguistic meaning of the term guardian in Arabic refers to the one who manages and looks after the affair of something or someone. However, in religion, it refers to the person who has the authority to manage the affairs of both the person and their property.<br/>b.    The ruling: The majority of scholars, namely the Maliki, Shafi’i, and Hanbali Madhabs, <span class="tip">            [31] The Maliki and   Shafi’i scholars hold the view that the consent of the guardian is one of the   pillars of the marriage contract while the Hanbali scholars view it as one of   the conditions of a valid marriage contract.     </span>  hold the view that the marriage of a woman is not valid without the consent of her guardian. Not only is it the view of many of the righteous predecessors, but it also reported that the Companions did not differ on this ruling.<br/>c.    Legal criteria of the guardian: <br/>                                              i.     Sanity: <br/>1.    permanent insanity: The guardian of the woman should be sane. The four Madhabs agree that the guardianship of a man who suffers from permanent insanity is deemed invalid.<br/>2.    Temporary insanity: The guardianship of a man who suffers temporary insanity is suspended until his sanity is restored. This is the view of the majority, the Hanafi, Maliki, and Hanbali Madhabs, and one of the views of the Shafi’i Madhab.<br/>                                             ii.     Puberty: The guardian of the woman must have reached puberty, as agreed on by the four Madhabs.<br/>                                           iii.     Freedom: The guardian of the woman must be a free person, as agreed on by the four Madhabs<br/>                                           iv.     Good Character (‘Adaalah) <span class="tip">            [32] A good character   here means uprightness in religion and good mannerism and refraining from that which is   forbidden and is able to avoid it.      </span> : It is not required for the guardian of the woman to be of good character. This is the view of the Hanafi Madhab, the famous view of the Maliki Madhab, one of the views in the Shafi’i Madhab, and one of the reported views of Imam Ahmad, and the favoured view of Ibn al-Qayyim, Ibn Baaz, Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, and Ibn Taymiyyah reported that it is the view of the majority of jurists. <br/>                                             v.     Sound Judgment (Rushd) <span class="tip">            [33] It refers to the   ability of the guardian to understand matters of compatibility and the   interests and purposes of marriage.     </span> : The guardian of the woman must have the ability to make sound judgments and also understands matters of compatibility and the interests and purposes of marriage. This is the view of the Shafi’i and Hanbali Madhab, one of the views in the Maliki Madhab, and the adopted view of Ibn al-Mundthir, al-Shawkaanee and Ibn ‘Uthaymeen.<br/>                                           vi.     He must be a male: The majority of scholars, namely the Shafi’i, Maliki, and Hanbali scholars, hold the view that the guardian of the woman must be a man.  <br/>                                         vii.     He should be of the same religion as the bride: <br/>1.    If the bride is a Muslim: It is a matter of consensus among scholars, as reported by Ibn al-Muthir, that the guardian must be a Muslim if the bride is Muslim.<br/>2.    If the bride is a non-Muslim: The four Madhabs <span class="tip">            [34] They exempted the   case when the guardian is Muslim, and the disbelieving woman is his slave. The   ruler can marry off the woman who is not Muslim if she has no guardian.      </span>  agree that the Muslim cannot be the guardian of a non-Muslim woman and that the disbeliever can be the guardian of a disbelieving woman. <br/>3.    The guardianship of the apostate: The four Madhabs agree that the apostate man cannot be the guardian of any woman, be she is Muslim, non-Muslim, or an apostate like him.<br/>                                        viii.     He must not be in a state of Ihraam: The majority of scholars, namely the Maliki, Shafi’i, and Hanbali scholars, hold the view that the guardian of a woman must not be in the state of Ihraam so he can act as her guardian. <br/>                                           ix.     Forced guardian: The majority of scholars, namely the Maliki, Shafi’i and Hanbali <span class="tip">            [35] The overall   discussion of this issue indicates that the guardian is not held liable if his   consent is given against his will.     </span>  scholars, agree that the marriage contract is invalid if the consent of the guardian is coerced.<br/>d.    The order of guardians in marriage:<br/>                                              i.     The priority of guardianship is given to her blood relatives, her manumitter, and the ruler, respectively: The four Madhabs agree that the most liable person to the guardianship of the woman as far as marriage is concerned is her blood relatives. If they are not available, the authority is passed to her manumitter if she was previously a slave.<br/>1.    The guardianship of blood relatives: The four Madhabs agree that the closest man in kinship from the paternal side is the most liable guardian of the woman as far as marriage is concerned, then the next closest and the next closest.  <span class="tip">            [36] The four Madhabs   agree on the following sequence of order of guardians: The most liable person   to the guardianship of the woman as far as marriage is concerned is her father,   then her brother, then her brother's son, then her paternal uncle, then her   paternal uncle's son, and so on.  However, the priority is given to the full   brother over her paternal half-brother, then her brother's son over the   paternal half-brother’s son, the full paternal uncle over the paternal   half-uncle. In the presence of a son, the Hanafi and Maliki Madhabs give him   precedence over the father while the Hanbali Madhab places him after the father   in order. As for the Shafi’i Madhab, the son has no authority to act as the   guardian of his mother. The majority of scholars hold that the paternal   grandfather, no matter how far the line of ascent reaches, comes after the   father while the Maliki Madhab places the paternal grandfather after the   brother’s son.     </span> <br/>2.    The guardianship of her manumitter: The four Madhabs agree that the guardianship of the freed woman who has no paternal blood relatives is given to her manumitter. If he is not available, then the right of guardianship passes to the closest of his kinship and so forth.<br/>3.    The guardianship of the ruler: There is a consensus among scholars that the guardian of the woman who has no paternal blood relatives is the head of state, ruler, or whoever acts on his behalf. This consensus is reported by Ibn Battaal, Ibn Hazm, Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr, Ibn Qudaamah, and Ibn Taymiyyah.<br/>4.     The guardian of a woman living in a non-Muslim country: If a woman has no guardian and it happens that she lives in a country where Islamic courts are not available, but they have an Islamic centre, the head of the Islamic centre can act as her guardian. This is the view of Ibn Baaz, the Permanent Committee, and the European Council for Fatwa and Research.<br/>5.    If a guardian marries off a woman while there is another guardian who has more priority is available. If one of the guardians approves the marriage contract all the while the guardian who is given more precedence is available, the marriage contract will be invalid. This is the view of the Shafi’i and Hanbali Madhabs and the favoured view of Ibn Hazm, Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn ‘Uthaymeen and the Permanent Committee.  <br/>6.    The ruling on a woman who gives her permission to two men to act as her guardians: The majority of scholars, namely the Maliki, Shafi’i and Hanbali scholars, hold the view that it is permissible for the woman to permit two of her guardians, who are both equally entitled to be her guardian, to conduct her marriage.<br/>7.    If the two guardians marry her off to two different men:<br/>a.    Knowing which of the two marriage contracts was conducted first: The four Madhabs agree that the first marriage will be valid while the other one is deemed invalid.<br/>b.    Not knowing which of the two marriage contracts was conducted first, or the two marriage contracts were conducted at the same time: The four Madhabs agree that both marriage contracts are deemed invalid if knowing which of the two marriage contracts was conducted first or if the two marriage contracts were conducted at the same time.<br/>e.      The guardian who is preventing his female ward from getting married <span class="tip">            [37] This refers to   the case when the guardian prevents his female ward from getting married to a   compatible man, and the groom and the bride wishes to proceed with this   marriage.  This is one of the unfortunate practises of some guardians who abuse   their authority to gain personal gains i.e., he would prevent his female ward   from getting married and deprives her of her legal rights hoping to force her   to give him money or because he demands large bride price (mahr). As such, he   rejects the marriage proposals of those who are pious and righteous and marries   her off to someone who is incompatible to her like an old man or a known sinner   only because he wishes to acquire something from the mortal worldly pleasures.     </span> : It is a matter of agreement between all scholars that it is forbidden for the guardian to prevent his female ward from getting married to a compatible man that she approves of his proposal. If he does so, then she can raise her case to the ruler or whoever acts on his behalf to marry her off to the groom. The consensus on this ruling is reported by al-Nawawee and Ibn Taymiyyah. <br/>4.    Being free of any obstacles that might prevent the marriage from being valid: The four Madhabs agree that one of the conditions of a marriage contract being valid is the absence of anything that would prevent the marriage from being valid in Islam. <span class="tip">            [38] Such as the   cases when the religion of the groom is not Islam or either of them is an   apostate, and so on.     </span> <br/>5.    Witnesses and announcement: <br/>a.    The announcement of the marriage<br/>                                              i.     The ruling on announcing the marriage: The four Madhabs agree that it is recommended to announce the marriage in public.<br/>                                             ii.      The ruling of conducting the marriage in secret <span class="tip">            [39] One of its contemporary forms is the   “friendship marriage”, which exists in some cultures. It is nothing but an   illicit relationship between a male and a female who engage in a sexual   relationship based on their intimate friendship without concluding a legal   marriage contract. Evidently, this kind of relationships is forbidden.      </span> AO2 : It is a matter of consensus among scholars that marriage contracts that are conducted in secret and without witnesses, which people endeavour to keep unknown to people, are invalid. The consensus is reported by Ibn al-’Arabee, Ibn Rushd, Al-Nawawee, and Ibn Taymiyyah.<br/>                                           iii.     The ruling on the marriage contract which the guardian, the witnesses, and the groom do not announce and keep in secret. The majority of scholars, namely the Hanafi, Shafi’i, and Hanbali <span class="tip">            [40] The Hanbali   Madhab considers it valid but disliked.      </span>  scholars, hold the view that it is valid. It is also the view of some of the righteous predecessors. <br/>b.    Witnessing the marriage contracts:<br/>                                              i.     The ruling of having no witnesses on the marriage contract: The majority of scholars <span class="tip">            [41] The Maliki   scholars hold that it is obligatory to have witnesses. If no witnesses were   present at the time of conducting the marriage contract, the witnesses must be   present before consummating the marriage. If the condition is not fulfilled,   and the husband consummated the marriage, the ruler will nullify the marriage   contract and consider it a divorce, to block the means of corruption.       </span> , namely the Hanafi, Shafi’i, and Hanbali scholars, hold the view that it is invalid <span class="tip">            [42] The Hanafi and   Hanbali Madhabs consider the witnesses as condition while the Maliki Madhab   considers it a pillar that must be fulfilled when consummating the marriage.      </span> , and it is the view of a group from the righteous predecessors. <br/>                                              ii.     Official documentation of marriages: If the marriage contract meets all the requirements, conditions, and pillars but is not officially registered in court records <span class="tip">            [43] This is one of the forms of ‘Urfi   marriages.      </span> AO3 , it is considered valid and binding. Nonetheless, it should be officially documented and registered in official records to protect the rights of the husband and wife. This is the fatwa of the Permanent Committee and the European Council for Fatwa and Research.<br/>c.    The conditions of the witnesses<br/>                                               i.     Puberty: The four Madhabs agree that the witnesses must have reached puberty.<br/>                                             ii.     Sanity: The four Madhabs agree that the witnesses must be sane.<br/>                                           iii.     Islam:<br/>1.    If the groom and bride are Muslim: The four Madhabs agree that the witnesses must be Muslims if the bride and groom were Muslims.<br/>2.    If the groom is Muslim and the woman is from the People of the Book: The witnesses must be Muslims if the groom is a Muslim and the bride is from the People of the Book. This is the view of the Shafi’i and Hanbali Madhabs, as well as the view of Muhammad and Zufar from the Hanafi Madhab. <br/>                                           iv.     Good conduct: It is not a condition for the witnesses to be of good conduct, which is the position of the Hanafi Madhab, and the view of some Maliki scholars, and one of the reports from Imam Ahmad.<br/>                                             v.     The ability to hear: The four Madhabs agree that witnesses must be able to hear as the witness of the deaf is invalid.<br/>                                            vi.     The ability to speak: It is not a condition for the witnesses to be able to speak. Hence, the mute can witness marriage contracts. This is the view of the Hanafi and Maliki and one of the views in the Shafi’i Madhab.<br/>                                           vii.     If the witnesses are from the descendants or ascendants of the groom, bride, or the guardian: The scholars differed on the ruling of the validity of the marriage contract if the witnesses are from the descendants or ascendants of the groom, the bride, or the guardian. The majority of scholars hold the view that the witnesses may not be from the descendants or ascendants of the groom, the bride, or the guardian. This is the view of the Hanafi, Maliki and Hanbali Madhabs and one of the views of the Shafi’i Madhab. The other view states that it is valid o long as none of the witnesses acts as the guardian at the same time. This is the adopted view in the Shafi’i Madhab, one of the views reported from Imam Ahmad and the chosen view of Ibn ‘Uthaymeen.<br/>d.    Compatibility<br/>                                              i.     Compatibility in religiousness: The four Madhabs agree that compatibility in piety and religiousness is considered in marriage contracts. As such, the vice and public sinner are not compatible with a chaste and pious woman. <br/>                                              ii.     Compatibility in linage: The compatibility in linage is not a condition, which is the view of the Maliki Madhab, the view of al-Kharkhee from the Hanafi scholars, the view of a group from the righteous predecessors, and the view of Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn al-Qayyim, al-Shawkaanee, Ibn Baaz, Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, and the fatwa of the Permanent Committee. <br/>                                            iii.     Compatibility in wealth <span class="tip">            [44] It includes all   that which has a value and can be sold or benefited from like money, real   estate, lands, animals and so on.     </span> : The compatibility in wealth is not a condition, which is the view of the Maliki Madhab, the correct view in the Shafi’i Madhab, and one of the views reported from Imam Ahmad.<br/>                                            iv.     Compatibility in profession and occupation: The compatibility in wealth is not a condition, which is the view of the Maliki Madhab, and one of the views reported from Imam Ahmad.<br/>
