Some are not legislated to be performed in congregation, like the prayer of guidance. Some supplement the wajib prayers, like sunnah and ratibah prayers. Some do not supplement other prayers, like the duha prayer. Some have a specific time, like the witr prayer. Some have a specific reason, like greeting the mosque and praying after wudu’.

Shafi`is and Hanbalis explicitly mention this, and Ibn `Uthaymin chose this position.  There are twelve units of rawatib prayers: two before fajr, four before zuhr and two after it, two after maghrib, and two after `isha’.

Ibn Hajar says:   “Some of the Salaf are of the opinion that this is mustahabb in   one’s house but not a mosque, and this is said to be according to Ibn `Umar.   Some of our teachers give weight to this opinion, saying that it has not been   related that the Prophet ﷺ did this in the   mosque. It is authentically narrated that Ibn `Umar that he would throw pebbles   at those doing it in the mosque, as narrated by Ibn Abu Shaybah.” (Fath   al-Bari, 3/44)     </span>  after the sunnah prayer of fajr. <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [418] Some scholars are of the   opinion that this is specific to those who offer the night prayer.     </span>  This is the position of the Shafi`i <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [419] It is sunnah according   to Shafi`is to lie down after the sunnah and wajib fajr   prayers.

The ruling of missing the night prayer:</b><br>Whoever misses the night prayer makes it up during the day. Hanbalis have explicitly mentioned this.

Definition of taraweeh:</span><br>Literally, taraweeh is the plural of tarweehah, which means a period of rest. It was so named because people would prolong standing, bowing, and prostrating in such prayers. They would rest after praying four units and then recommence by praying four more. Then they would rest and then pray three more. <br>Legally, taraweeh is the night prayer during Ramadan.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.     Ruling of praying taraweeh:</span><br>The taraweeh prayer is a confirmed sunnah. Consensus on it being sunnah was related by al-Nawawi, Shaykhi Zadeh, and al-San`ani.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">3.     The ruling of praying taraweeh in congregation in a mosque:</span><br>Praying taraweeh in congregation in a mosque is better than praying it alone. Consensus on this was related by Ibn `Abd al-Barr, Ibn Qudamah, and others.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">4.     When to pray taraweeh:</span><br>The sunnah is to pray taraweeh after `isha’.

Recitation during taraweeh:</span><br>There is no specific amount of Qur’an that must be recited during taraweeh, but it is mustahabb to recite the entire Qur’an. <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [430] Ibn Taymiyyah says: “As for   reciting the Qur’an during taraweeh, it is mustahabb by the   agreement of Muslim imams. Rather, one of the greatest objectives of taraweeh   is the recitation of the Qur’an during it such that Muslims might hear the   speech of Allah. For it was during Ramadan that the Qur’an was revealed and   during it Jibreel would teach the Prophet ﷺ the   Qur’an.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 23/122-123)     </span> <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">7.

It is also so according to one narration from Abu Hanifah, and Hanafis such as Abu Yusuf and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan also held this position. It is the position of most scholars.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">2.     When witr starts and ends:</span><br>The time for witr starts after the `isha’ prayer and ends at the emergence of dawn (fajr). This is the position of the majority: the Malikis, Shafi`is, and Hanbalis. It is the position of Hanafis such as Abu Yusuf and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Best time for witr:</span><br>Praying witr during the last portion of the night is best for someone who expects to rise during the last portion of the night.

Praying one unit of witr:</span><br>It is permissible to pray one unit of witr separate from anything before it. This is the position of the majority: the Malikis <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [432] It is permissible to pray one   unit of witr according to Malikis, though it is makruh to pray   one unit of witr without offering an even-number of units (shaf`)   before it.     </span> , Shafi`is, and Hanbalis.

It is the position of choice according to Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Baz, and Ibn `Uthaymin.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">6.     Praying witr as three contiguous units with two tashahhuds:</span><br>It is not legislated to pray witr as three contiguous units with two tashahhuds in a manner similar to the maghrib prayer.

It is also permissible to recite the tashahhud   during the last two units of prayer.      </span>  one position among Hanbalis, <span class="tip" style="font-weight: normal;">            [434] The positon of the Hanbali   school is that all formulations given are permissible with the exception of   sitting for the tashahhud during both the sixth and seventh units of   prayer.

Also,   doing so entails abandoning the rest of the Qur’an.”     </span> <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">9.     Reciting out loud or quietly during witr:</span><br>This issue will follow when discussing reciting out loud or quietly during optional prayers.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">10.

Praying behind an imam and following him in witr while desiring to pray witr during the last portion of the night:</span><br>Whoever prays behind an imam and wishes to follow him in praying witr while also desiring to pray witr during the last portion of the night does not give salams when the imam does, but instead rises and prays another unit to even out the number prayed behind the imam. Ahmad explicitly mentioned this, and this is the position of choice of Ibn Baz and Ibn `Uthaymin.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">12.
