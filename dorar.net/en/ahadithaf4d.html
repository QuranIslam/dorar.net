So I said: O Messenger of Allah, why did you not give to So-and-so? For by Allah, I think that he is a believer. He said: “Or a Muslim.” I kept quiet for a little while, then what I knew of him prompted me to speak again, and I repeated what I had said: I said: Why did you leave out So-and-so? For by Allah, I think that he is a believer. He said: “Or a Muslim.” Then what I knew of him prompted me to speak again, and I repeated what I had said, and the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) repeated what he had said. Then he said: “O Sa‘d, I may give to one man when someone else is dearer to me than him, for fear that Allah may throw him into the Fire.”.

                            Commentary :</strong>
                          The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to deal with people on the basis of prophetic wisdom, so he knew what was appropriate for each individual around him, and he would deal with him in a manner that could help to rectify his condition and make him steadfast in faith.<br />
In this hadith, Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) gave some wealth to a group of those whose hearts were to be softened (towards faith), for many people enter Islam in the hope of gaining wealth or status, then later on faith takes root in their hearts, and they become among the best of the Muslims. The word translated here as “a number of people” refers to a group of between three and ten. This incident happened in the presence of Sa‘d (may Allah be pleased with him), and the Prophet left out one man, giving him nothing; that man was the one whom Sa‘d admired the most, and he was the best and most righteous of them, or so Sa‘d thought. So Sa‘d (may Allah be pleased with him) asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) the reason why he had left out that man, even though he thought he was a believer on the basis of outward signs which seemed to indicate that he had strong faith. The Prophet (listings and peace of Allah be upon him) responded by saying “Or a Muslim”; what he meant was: do not hasten to deem someone a believer. This was a rebuke to Sa‘d for testifying that someone was a believer, because belief or faith is hidden in the heart, and no one can see it, so testifying to that effect is a testimony that is based on conjecture. So no one should affirm such a thing. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed Sa‘d to testify to the man being a Muslim, because that is something that can be seen. But Sa‘d (may Allah be pleased with him) did not understand why the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) responded by saying “Or a Muslim”. If he had understood that, it could have prevented him from saying that again, so he repeated his words, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) repeated the response that he had given the first time.<br />
Then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained to Sa‘d the reason why he had given to some and had withheld from others, so he said: I may give to a man to soften his heart by means of that gift, for fear that he may become a disbeliever if he is not given anything; I am afraid that if I do not give him anything, he may develop an idea because of which he may become a disbeliever, and then Allah will throw him into the Fire. As for the one whose faith is strong, he is dearer to me, so I entrust him to his faith and I do not fear that he will recant his religion or develop bad ideas if I do not give him anything.<br />
This hadith indicates that part of the teachings of Islam is not to definitively affirm that anyone has faith in his heart, or to swear to that on the basis of what appears to us of his being Muslim and adhering to the teachings of Islam, even though we should treat a person as a Muslim and classify him as such on the basis of what appears outwardly to be the case.<br />
It also indicates that when these two terms, faith (iman) and Islam appear together, then each of them has a different meaning; in that case, Islam refers to outward actions, and faith refers to inward deeds of the heart. .

                            It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I was shown the Fire, and I saw that most of its inhabitants were women, for they are ungrateful.” It was said: Are they ungrateful to Allah? He said: “They are ungrateful to their husbands; they are ungrateful for kind treatment. If you show kindness to one of them for a lifetime, then she sees one thing from you, she says: I have never seen any good from you.”.

                            Commentary :</strong>
                          Allah (may He be glorified) created Paradise for His patient and obedient slaves, and He created the Fire for those who refuse, turn away from Him and are ungrateful for His blessings. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) explained the characteristics of many of those who will enter it.<br />
In this hadith, he described one of the characteristics of the people of Hell which is common among women in particular. One day, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) exhorted the women and said to them: I was shown the Fire; Allah (may He be exalted) caused me to look at it by His might, so I saw it with my own eyes. When I looked at it and saw who was in it, I saw that the majority of its inhabitants were women. One of the women said: Why is that, O Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)? He replied: They will be the majority of the inhabitants of the Fire because they are ungrateful. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not say what they were ungrateful for, so that the women would become curious and want to find out what type of ingratitude he was attributing to them, and also to make their fear greater. Hardly had the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) spoken these words but one of the women asked: Are they ungrateful to Allah? He said: Rather they are ungrateful to their husbands and are ungrateful for kind treatment. In other words, they deny the blessing of the husband and his kind treatment towards them. If the husband treats one of them kindly for an entire lifetime, then she sees one thing from him that she dislikes, she says: I have never seen anything from you that has benefitted me or made me feel happy in my entire life!<br />
Denying blessings is forbidden because if a woman denies the blessing of her husband, she has denied the blessing of Allah, for this blessing that reached her from her husband is in fact a blessing that came from Allah.<br />
Ingratitude towards the husband is mentioned in particular among other types of sins for a subtle and amazing reason, which is the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “If I were to instruct anyone to prostrate to anyone else, I would have instructed women to prostrate to their husbands.” This was narrated by Ahmad and others. The husband’s right over his wife is mentioned alongside the right of Allah because if a woman denies her husband’s rights when his rights over her are so great, this indicates that she is neglecting the rights of Allah. Hence it is described as kufr (which may mean ingratitude or disbelief), but it is not the kufr which may put one beyond the bounds of Islam.<br />
This hadith indicates that kufr is of two types, and that the word kufr may refer to something other than disbelief in Allah (may He be exalted), such as when it refers to ingratitude for blessings, which is a denial of those blessings..

                            It was narrated that al-Ma‘rur ibn Suwayd said: I met Abu Dharr in ar-Rabadhah. He was wearing a hullah (suit) and his slave was also wearing a hullah. I asked him about that, and he said: I insulted a man and shamed him because of his mother’s origins, then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “O Abu Dharr, did you shame him because of his mother’s origins? Indeed you are a man in whom there is some ignorance (jahiliyyah). Your servants are your brothers whom Allah has put under your control, so whoever has been given control over his brother, let him feed him the same food as he eats, and clothe him in the same garments as he wears. Do not burden them with work that may be overwhelming for them, and if you do assign such work to them, then help them.”.

                          Islam is a religion of sublime manners and etiquette with all people, even servants. It is a religion that does not differentiate between people on the basis of lineage, status, race or colour. Rather differentiation is based on piety and righteous deeds. In this hadith, Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) had insulted a man and shamed him because of his mother’s origins by saying “O son of a foreign woman” or “O son of a black woman” and the like. When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) came to know of that, he rebuked Abu Dharr for it, saying: “Did you shame him because of his mother’s origins?” In other words, did you insult him and accuse him of being a shameful person because of his mother? “Indeed you are a man in whom there is some ignorance (jahiliyyah).” Insulting people, impugning them and shaming them are characteristics of ignorance, so this is a deterrent from doing such things, and it highlights how abhorrent such actions are.<br />
Then the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said to him, teaching him, disciplining him and informing him about the rights of servants: “Your servants are your brothers whom Allah has put under your control.” In other words, your servants and slaves who take care of your affairs, and are Muslims, are your brothers in faith whom Allah (may He be glorified and exalted) has put under your control, “so whoever has been given control over his brother, let him feed him the same food as he eats, and clothe him in the same garments as he wears. Do not burden them with work that may be overwhelming for them, and if you do assign such work to them, then help them.” So do not ask them to do more work than they are able to do, and if you instruct them to do any such work, then you must help them. When Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) heard these words from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), he gave his servant a garment like his own, as al-Ma‘rur ibn Suwayd saw him in ar-Rabadhah – which is a place near Madinah -  wearing a hullah, which is a suit composed of two garments, a lower garment (izar or waist wrapper) and an upper garment (rida’ or cloak), and he saw his servant also wearing a hullah. That was in obedience to what Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) had heard from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).<br />
This hadith highlights the abhorrent nature of the characteristics and attitudes of the jahiliyyah, and tells us that they are to be shunned, in accordance with the teachings of Islam.<br />
It also encourages us to show kindness to slaves and servants and others in similar positions, such as hired workers and the like, and to treat them gently.<br />
It also teaches us not to look down on a fellow Muslim and despise them.<br />
It also highlights the clear virtue of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) and his good response to the command of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)..

                            Commentary :</strong>
                          Shedding blood unlawfully is one of the greatest sins with which a person could meet Allah (may He be exalted), and Allah (may He be glorified and exalted) has warned the one who kills a Muslim unlawfully of a lasting punishment. That is why a group of the companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stayed away from the turmoil (fitnah) that occurred after the murder of ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affan (may Allah be pleased with him) for fear of playing any part in the shedding of blood unlawfully, which Allah (may He be exalted) would question them about on the Day of Resurrection. One of those who stayed away from fighting was Abu Bakrah Nufay‘ ibn al-Harith (may Allah be pleased with him). According to this hadith, when Abu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased with him) saw al-Ahnaf ibn Qays going to join the fighting, he said to him: Where are you going? He said To support this man, referring to ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) in the Battle of the Camel, which took place in 36 AH. This was a battle which led to a great deal of turmoil; it took place in Basra between ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) and his supporters on the one hand, and al-Zubayr, Talhah and ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with them) and their supporters on the other hand. ‘A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) had gone there to try to bring about reconciliation, not to fight, then matters got out of hand and there happened what happened. Abu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased with him) told al-Ahnaf to go back, then he told him that he had heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: If two Muslims meet and fight with their swords for worldly gain, or without any legitimate justification according to Islamic teachings, then the killer and the slain both deserve to enter Hell.<br />
Abu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased with him) asked, seeking to understand: ‘O Messenger of Allah, the case of the killer [is clear], but what about the one who was slain?’ In other words: why would he enter the Fire even though he is the one who was killed? The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) answered him by saying: “He was keen to kill his opposite number.” He wanted to kill his opposite number, and if he had had the opportunity to kill him, he would have done so. This does not include a Muslim who fights off another Muslim who is attacking him, for he should fight to protect his wealth or honour, even if he kills or is killed.<br />
The fact that both of them will be in the Fire does not mean that they will abide therein forever. Rather this is a punishment for this sin, then it is up to Allah (may He be exalted): if He wills, He will punish them then bring them out of the Fire like others who affirm His oneness (but commit sins), and if He wills He will pardon them and not punish them at all. Remaining in Hell forever is only for one who regards it as permissible to kill a fellow Muslim.<br />
This hadith indicates that for a Muslim to fight his fellow Muslim for no legitimate reason is a major sin, and that the one who commits a major sin does not become a disbeliever thereby, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) described both fighting parties as Muslims.  .

Then Allah (may He be glorified in exalted) revealed the words, {Indeed, association [with Him] is great injustice} [Luqmaan 31:13]..

                            Commentary :</strong>
                          Associating others with Allah is the gravest of major sins and the worst act of zulm (injustice, wrongdoing). It is an injustice that the one who associates others with Allah does to himself, because Allah has made clear to all people the path of guidance and the way to learn about Allah and His Oneness.<br />
In this hadith, ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (may Allah be pleased with him) narrates that when the verse {They who believe and do not mix their belief with injustice (zulm)} [al-An‘am 6:82] was revealed, the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) were distressed by that, because they thought that what was meant by zulm was sin in general, as one might initially understand, especially because the Arabic word appears in the indefinite form, which would suggest a general meaning referring to any act of wrongdoing. They were worried about that because the apparent meaning of the word zulm is to transgress against people and not give them their dues, and to transgress against oneself by committing sins. Hence they thought that what was meant here was the apparent meaning that first springs to mind, which is doing that which is not appropriate and is contrary to Islamic teachings. So they were concerned, because no one is safe from falling into such sins. Then Allah revealed the words: {Indeed, association [with Him] is great injustice (zulm)} [Luqman 31:13]. Thus it became clear that what is meant is the worst type of zulm, which is shirk (associating others with Allah). Shirk is tantamount to zulm because Allah (may He be glorified) is the Bestower of all blessings, so if His slave associates anything else with Him, he has committed a grave wrong (zulm)..
